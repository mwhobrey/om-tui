# Agent & operator runbook

Hard-won operational knowledge for working on a **live** OpenMessage install
(supporting a real user, debugging sends, re-pairing). If you are an automated
agent doing a support task, read this first — most of it cost hours to learn
the hard way.

## Data layout — the #1 gotcha

There are **multiple separate data directories**, and they are **not the same store**:

| Used by | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **macOS app** (live) | `~/Library/Application Support/OpenMessage/` | The real `messages.db` + `session.json`. `BackendManager` launches the backend with `OPENMESSAGES_DATA_DIR` set to this. |
| **CLI default (macOS/Linux)** | `~/.local/share/openmessage/` | What `openmessage read/status/pair/serve` use when run with **no** env var. Frequently **stale** relative to the app. |
| **Windows CLI / TUI** | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OpenMessage` | Default for this fork's Windows path. Pair, `serve`, and `tui` must share it. River credentials: `rivers/<id>/credentials.enc` (DPAPI). |

Consequences:

- To read or modify the **app's live data** from the CLI on macOS, set
  `OPENMESSAGES_DATA_DIR="$HOME/Library/Application Support/OpenMessage"`.
  Querying `~/.local/share/openmessage/messages.db` shows a different
  (usually older) message history — do not trust it for "what did the user
  just receive/send."
- On Windows, point everything at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OpenMessage` (or a shared
  `OPENMESSAGES_DATA_DIR`). Product path: [windows-tui.md](windows-tui.md).
  Architecture / current state: [runbook/](runbook/).
- `BackendManager.migrateOldDataIfNeeded()` copies `session.json` (+ db files)
  from `~/.local/share/openmessage` → App Support **only when App Support has
  no `session.json`**. So to force the app unpaired you must clear the session
  in **both** dirs (see re-pairing below), or the migration restores it.

## Reading the user's live messages

The running app holds `messages.db` open in WAL mode, so a second SQLite reader
often fails with `unable to open database file (14)`, and `?immutable=1` opens
but misses WAL-only (recent) writes. **Prefer the running app's HTTP API**
(loopback-guarded; `curl` from localhost passes the origin check):

```
GET /api/status
GET /api/conversations?limit=500
GET /api/conversations/<conversation_id>/messages?limit=N
GET /api/search?q=<term>
```

Outgoing message rows carry a `Status`: `OUTGOING_SENDING` → `OUTGOING_SENT`/
`OUTGOING_DELIVERED`, or `OUTGOING_FAILED:<STATUS>` when a send is rejected.

## MCP serving — exactly one process may own live transports

**The failure mode (empirically confirmed 2026-07-20):** `openmessage serve
--mcp-stdio` used to start the **full transport stack** — the Google,
WhatsApp, and Signal supervisors auto-started in every serve mode. MCP hosts
(Claude Code via `~/.mcp.json`, Claude Desktop) spawn one such process **per
session**, each connecting with the **same WhatsApp device credentials and
signal-cli account as the running app**. WhatsApp treats that as a second
device login and kills the session — a fresh pairing at 20:40:41 was dead with
`401: logged out from another device` by 20:41:07, seconds after two Claude
MCP processes spawned. Concurrent signal-cli pollers likewise corrupt/deauth
Signal (the 2026-07-13 WhatsApp logout and Signal's `needs_reauth` death were
this same fratricide). `instance.lock` never protected against this — only
`backup` and `migrate` honor it.

**The fix: MCP client mode.** `serve --mcp-stdio` with no other transport
(the exact shape MCP hosts spawn) is now a **transportless client** of the
running app:

- **Zero transport supervisors, zero dispatchers, zero sync loops, zero
  schedulers, zero telemetry.** The app daemon owns all of those. Regression
  tests: `TestRunServeMCPStdioStartsZeroTransportSupervisors` (cmd) and
  `TestBuiltBinaryMCPStdioClientShapeStartsNoTransports` (binary-level).
- **Reads stay local** (store attach, WAL-safe). At startup the client probes
  the daemon (`/api/status`); if the daemon serves the same data dir and
  reports v2-primary, the client reads the v2 store. With the daemon down it
  falls back to `OPENMESSAGES_V2_*` env exactly like `openmessage read`.
  If `OPENMESSAGES_DATA_DIR` is unset, the client adopts the data dir the
  daemon reports — set it explicitly in the MCP config anyway (see below).
- **The store opens repair-free** (`app.NewClient`): the startup repair
  sweeps (legacy artifacts, contentless recency, tapbacks, empty stubs,
  WhatsApp media placeholders) run only in store-owning entrypoints
  (`app.New` — the daemon and write-capable CLI commands). One client spawns
  per Claude session, so dozens of concurrent sessions must not each burst
  repair writes into the live `messages.db`. The read-only CLI
  (`read`/`status`) opens the legacy store the same way. Regression tests:
  `TestNewClientPerformsNoStoreWrites` (internal/app),
  `TestRunServeMCPClientDoesNotRepairStore` and
  `TestOpenCommandReadSourceLegacyDoesNotRepairStore` (cmd).
- **Sends/reactions route through the daemon** (`/api/v1/outbox` on v2,
  `/api/send`+`/api/react` on legacy), like the CLI has done since PR #140,
  with the same do-not-resend idempotency contract. With the app closed,
  send tools return an actionable "start the OpenMessage app" error — they
  never fall back to opening their own connections.
- Escape hatches: `--transports` forces the old standalone full-stack stdio
  behavior (only for machines where the MCP process is the *only* OpenMessage
  process, ever); `--no-transports` strips transports from a **legacy-mode**
  web/SSE shape (degraded debug instance: local reads work, sends fail with
  "not connected"). On a **v2-primary** install a `--web --no-transports`
  process refuses to start — the v2 read path there needs the dispatcher
  stack — so use the MCP client shape or `openmessage read` for store access
  instead.

**MCP config (`~/.mcp.json`) for a macOS app install:**

```json
"openmessage": {
  "command": "/usr/local/bin/openmessage",
  "args": ["serve", "--mcp-stdio"],
  "env": {
    "OPENMESSAGES_DATA_DIR": "/Users/<user>/Library/Application Support/OpenMessage",
    "OPENMESSAGES_V2_PRIMARY": "1"
  }
}
```

Pin `OPENMESSAGES_DATA_DIR` to the app's dir so reads, the control token, and
daemon-truth detection all line up (two-data-dirs trap above). On a migrated
(v2-primary) install, also set `OPENMESSAGES_V2_PRIMARY=1` — the legacy
`messages.db` froze at cutover, and this keeps MCP reads on the v2 store even
when the app is closed or predates the `auth.data_dir` status field (drop the
line on a non-migrated install). Keep the PATH binary in lockstep with the
installed app — both open the same SQLite stores and a version-skewed binary
can migrate the schema under the older one.

**Never** configure MCP to run `serve --web`, `serve --mcp-sse`, or
`serve ... --transports` alongside the app: those are daemon shapes and will
fight the app for the WhatsApp/Signal sessions exactly as described above.

## Pairing & the "zombie session"

**Symptom:** sends fail with `OUTGOING_FAILED:UNKNOWN`; `/api/status` shows
`google.connected=true`; reconnect and app restarts don't help. The Google
Messages **linked-device session has lapsed** — the phone silently unlinked the
device (common after travel / network changes). The connection flag lies; the
session is dead for sends.

Key facts:

- The native macOS **Platforms** view (`OpenMessageApp.swift`) only offers a
  re-pair control when the session is **absent** (`!google.paired` →
  `ContentView` shows `PairingView`). While it believes it's connected it shows
  "Open inbox / Sync history" with **no re-pair button**. That "Open inbox"
  string is **native Swift, not a stale webview cache** — don't go chasing
  WKWebView caches (a red herring that cost real time). As of PR #42 the **web
  UI** surfaces a "Google Messages isn't sending — Re-pair" banner when
  `google.needs_repair` is set (3 consecutive Google send failures while
  connected). Issue #43 tracks adding the same affordance to the native view.
- **QR pairing is dead** — Google disabled device-pairing QR for many accounts.
  Use **Google Account pairing**.

### Re-pair recipe (the one that works)

1. `osascript -e 'quit app "OpenMessage"'`.
2. Force the native pairing screen by removing `session.json` from **both**
   data dirs (back them up first):
   `~/Library/Application Support/OpenMessage/session.json` **and**
   `~/.local/share/openmessage/session.json` (else migration copies the old one
   back). Other platforms' sessions (`whatsapp-session.db`, `signal-cli/`) are
   independent — leave them.
3. **Clear the stale session FIRST (don't skip).** Running `pair --google` while a dead `session.json` is still in the data dir floods the pairing with `failed to decrypt data event: HMAC mismatch` and yields a new session that 401s on token refresh **immediately** (dead on arrival). Removing both `session.json` files (step 2) before pairing is what produces a healthy session that connects *and* syncs (`/api/status` freshness `behind_days` drops to 0). Some HMAC-mismatch lines are normal noise (events from the phone's own session the pairing client can't read) — the tell for a bad pair is an immediate post-pair 401, not the noise itself.
4. The embedded Google sign-in inside `PairingView` is **blocked by Google**
   ("sign-in not allowed in this app") and dead-ends in Google's troubleshooter.
   Use the **cookie method** instead — extract Google cookies from the user's
   signed-in Chrome and run:
   ```
   OPENMESSAGES_DATA_DIR="$HOME/Library/Application Support/OpenMessage" \
     openmessage pair --google-file <cookiefile>
   ```
   Decrypting Chrome cookies on macOS:
   - key: `security find-generic-password -w -s "Chrome Safe Storage"`
   - derive: PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA1(key, salt=`saltysalt`, iterations=1003, len=16)
   - decrypt each `encrypted_value`: strip `v10` prefix, AES-128-CBC, IV = 16
     spaces, strip PKCS7 padding; recent Chrome prepends a 32-byte domain hash —
     try stripping the first 32 bytes if the result isn't clean UTF-8.
   - source: `~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Cookies`
     (the signed-in profile; `Local State` maps profiles → accounts). Build a
     `name=value; name=value; …` header from `.google.com` / `messages.google.com`
     cookies and write it to a `0600` file.
   - **Cookies rotate roughly every 30 minutes** → extract fresh **immediately**
     before pairing, or `pair --google` returns HTTP 401.
4. `pair --google` prints `EMOJI: <emoji>`. The user taps that emoji in Google
   Messages **on the phone** (notification shade, or profile → Device pairing)
   to confirm. The Gaia client init can time out once — just retry.
6. On confirmation the session saves to the app dir; relaunch the app and sends
   work. Wipe the cookie file afterwards.

### Self-healing (as of #74; requirements fixed 2026-07-20) — try this before any manual cookie surgery

The macOS app **refreshes expired Google cookies in-process** and reconnects
on its own. When the reconnect watchdog sees an expired session
(`auth token: HTTP 401` / `SESSION_COOKIE_INVALID`) it reads the user's
signed-in Chrome cookies, rewrites `auth_data.cookies` in `session.json`, and
reconnects — no re-pair, no script. Implemented in `internal/googlecookies`
(darwin-only; keychain → PBKDF2 → AES-128-CBC, handles the Chrome 130+
`SHA256(host)` prefix, snapshots the cookie DB + WAL for freshness).
`refreshGoogleSessionCookies` prefers an explicit
`OPENMESSAGE_COOKIE_REFRESH_SCRIPT` if set, else this native path;
`canRefreshGoogleCookies()` gates whether the watchdog refreshes or parks.

**Cookie requirements (the 2026-07-20 fix):** a Google-account libgm session
authenticates with the five `.google.com` account cookies
(SID/HSID/SSID/APISID/SAPISID) + SAPISIDHASH — proven live against both
`/web/config` and the RegisterRefresh RPC. A `messages.google.com:OSID`
service cookie exists **only** if the user has opened Messages-for-web in that
Chrome profile; it is preferred when present but **never required**. (Before
the fix, refresh hard-required it, so on profiles that never visited
messages.google.com every repair failed with `missing required cookies:
messages.google.com:OSID` and the app looped in `needs_repair` forever — a
re-pair bought minutes, then died again.)

**Expected steady-state:** Google invalidates replayed browser-cookie
snapshots after ~14 minutes of Chrome concurrently advancing the same account
session (measured 2026-07-20: 14 clean minutes of 200s, then
`SESSION_COOKIE_INVALID`; fresh-pair sessions died in ~3-4 min). The healthy
pattern is therefore a **heal cycle**: connected → cookie 401 → watchdog
refresh from Chrome → reconnect, repeating every ~15 min with sub-minute dips.
Rotated cookies are also persisted to `session.json` (throttled, ~5 min) so a
restart resumes from fresh values instead of pair-time snapshots. That write is
atomic (temp file + fsync + rename), so a crash mid-save can never truncate the
paired credentials; a failed save retries at a tenth of the interval instead of
waiting a full one.

**Is revocation running fast?** Automatic repairs are paced to at least
`OPENMESSAGE_REPAIR_MIN_INTERVAL` (default 90s). Every delayed repair logs
`Delaying Google credential repair` (with `wait` and `paced_total`) and bumps
`google.repairs_paced` in `/api/status`:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:7007/api/status | jq '.google.repairs_paced'
```

Absent/0 is the healthy ~15-minute heal cycle. A climbing count means repairs
are being requested faster than the floor — i.e. something is revoking the
imported cookies within minutes, which pacing throttles but does not fix. Read
it before concluding a heal loop is "just slow".

An `auth_expired` session with its device link intact revives by cookie
rewrite alone — **do not re-pair** for `needs_repair`; that resets nothing the
refresh can't fix and risks pairing throttles. So the **first** thing to try
when SMS is dead is nothing — wait ~15-60s for the watchdog. If it hasn't
recovered, the cookies are genuinely gone from Chrome (user signed out of
Google there) or the device link was revoked; only then fall back to the
manual re-pair recipe above. The app also posts a **health notification**
(once, on the rising edge) when Google flips to `needs_repair` or WhatsApp
logs out, so a dead platform can't sit silent for days.

Prereq: the app must be **non-sandboxed** (it is — `OpenMessage.entitlements`
is hardened-runtime only) so the backend can read Chrome's cookie DB and the
`Chrome Safe Storage` keychain item. First keychain read may prompt once;
Always Allow persists it.

### gmessages fork contract

**Root cause of the repeated deaths (fixed in #73):** the `MaxGhenis/gmessages`
fork was frozen at its 2026-03-02 base and missed upstream's 2026-05-05
[`libgm/longpoll: retry on network error when refreshing auth token`](https://github.com/mautrix/gmessages/commit/0b54a8fe65207f81d353ffe63f4d2549c2eb7976).
Without it, a single transient network blip during a scheduled token refresh
permanently killed the session.

The replacement in `go.mod` pins fork commit
[`0e43542dfa0e`](https://github.com/MaxGhenis/gmessages/commit/0e43542dfa0e0b97e410f185a5842e8740106099).
It is upstream `mautrix/gmessages` base
[`3433cc07d5ea`](https://github.com/mautrix/gmessages/commit/3433cc07d5ea9522309adad3a8c92ed5b08dc11d),
which contains the auth-refresh retry, plus exactly one carried patch:
`Add ListConversationsWithCursor for paginated conversation listing`. That
method is required by OpenMessage's backfill and reconciliation paths.

**Keep the fork rebased on upstream.** The weekly
`gmessages-fork-drift.yml` workflow records the base and patch set and fails as
soon as upstream `main` advances. When rebasing, replay the single carried
patch, verify the auth-refresh retry is still present, and update the fork pin
and recorded SHAs together. The durable architectural fix (move SMS/RCS onto
an Android companion) is issue #75.

### Don't over-reconnect

Connecting/disconnecting the Google web session many times in a short window
(repeated restarts, `reconnect` calls, multiple `pair` runs) gets the account
**throttled** — the long-poll drops and `/api/status` shows
`"Google Messages connection lost; reconnecting…"` in a loop with a perfectly
valid session. The fix is to **stop and let it cool down** (minutes up to ~1h),
not to hammer reconnect. Sends may land in brief connected windows meanwhile.

## WhatsApp linking (QR and phone-number code)

Hard-won facts from the 2026-07-03/04 re-pair ordeal:

- **Passkey-protected accounts can't use phone-number code linking.** If the
  account has a WhatsApp passkey, the server accepts the typed code
  (`companion_finish` returns ok) and then sends `passkey_prologue_request` —
  a WebAuthn challenge only the user's real authenticator can answer. The
  phone shows "Couldn't link device"; the desktop used to idle silently
  (whatsmeow logged "Unhandled notification"). The bridge now surfaces a
  clear "account is protected by a passkey — scan the QR code instead" error
  via `events.PairPasskeyRequest`. QR linking does **not** involve the
  passkey step (the camera scan is the verification).
- **Code + QR windows are short.** Pairing codes expire in ~2 minutes;
  QR refs rotate ~20–60s within a ~3-minute session that ends silently
  (`qr_event: "timeout"`). Generate the code / show the QR only when the
  user's phone is already on the entry/scanner screen.
- **"Couldn't link device. Try again later." on every QR scan = WhatsApp
  refusing, not our bug.** Two causes: (a) zombie companion entries from
  failed attempts eating the 4-device limit — have the user clear stale
  entries in WhatsApp → Linked Devices; (b) a temporary linking throttle
  after repeated failed attempts — stop retrying for a few hours (hammering
  extends it). If a single clean attempt after cleanup + cooldown still
  fails, remove the WhatsApp passkey (Settings → Account → Passkeys), link,
  re-add it.
- **Debugging:** whatsmeow logs used to be discarded (`waLog.Noop`); they now
  flow through the bridge logger (`component=whatsmeow`). Debug-level os_log
  lines are NOT persisted — capture live with
  `log stream --predicate 'subsystem == "com.openmessage.app"' --level debug`
  **before** the attempt; `log show` after the fact only has warn/error.
- **`go.work` gotcha:** the repo root had an untracked `go.work` whose
  `use ../tmp/whatsmeow` silently overrode go.mod's whatsmeow pin for every
  workspace-mode build (including `macos/build.sh`). If a dependency bump
  mysteriously doesn't take, check `go.work`.

## signal-cli

Require **signal-cli ≥ 0.14.5**. 0.14.1 throws
`NullPointerException: …getSender() … content is null` on certain inbound
envelopes, exits non-zero, never ACKs, and re-hits the same poison message every
poll — a crash loop that flaps the Signal `connected` flag every few seconds and
makes the whole UI flicker. `brew upgrade signal-cli` fixes it. (PR #41 also
hardened the UI to ignore redundant status pushes.)

## Deploying a new build to a live install

```
DEVELOPER_ID="Developer ID Application: Max Ghenis (8VB5UKQZC6)" ./macos/build.sh
osascript -e 'quit app "OpenMessage"'      # fully quit; `open -a` on a running app won't relaunch it
rm -rf /Applications/OpenMessage.app && cp -R macos/build/OpenMessage.app /Applications/
xattr -cr /Applications/OpenMessage.app
open -a OpenMessage
```

The user's data and pairing **persist** — they live in the data dir, not in the
`.app` bundle. A fresh restart re-establishes the Google long-poll, which can
briefly show "reconnecting" before it settles (see throttling note above).

## Verifying after support work

- `curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' http://127.0.0.1:7007/` → 200
- `/api/status` → `google/whatsapp/signal` connection + `google.needs_repair`
  (and `google.repairs_paced`, which should stay 0/absent)
- A real send shows `OUTGOING_DELIVERED` in
  `/api/conversations/<id>/messages`. Don't re-send a user's real message as a
  "test" (duplicate risk on `UNKNOWN`, which is ambiguous about whether it sent);
  if you must test connectivity, get explicit per-send permission.
- For the ingest cutover checklist, run the [ingest smoke](#ingest-smoke)
  before switching readers.

### Ingest smoke

Read `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:7007/api/status | jq '.v2_ingest'`. A healthy
enabled stack reports `enabled: true`; under `per_account`, `appended` grows as
receive frames arrive, message-bearing frames advance `projected`, and
`quarantined` remains `0`. An idle WhatsApp or Signal account can legitimately
stay at zero until a new inbound/history frame arrives.

The manual receive-only check is:

```sh
LIVE_PLATFORMS=google GOWORK=off go test -tags livetransport \
  -run TestLiveIngestVerification -v -count=1 -timeout 10m \
  ./internal/livetransport/
```

It sends nothing. Add `whatsapp` or `signal` to the comma-separated
`LIVE_PLATFORMS` list only when that platform will receive a real frame within
the test deadline; use `LIVE_GOOGLE_CONV`, `LIVE_WHATSAPP_CONV`, or
`LIVE_SIGNAL_CONV` to override the expected self-thread remote ID.
